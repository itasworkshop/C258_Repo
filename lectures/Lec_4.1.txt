MySQL Database

Data --> useful information

DBMS - Database Management System
Database --> organisation structure

RDBMS -Relational Database Management System
we are organising our data in terms of table
table --> rows and columns

Example: -
collage DBMS

Departments
id		Dept_Name		Location
111	computer			Block-B
222	civil				Block-C
333	mechanical		Block-D

Students
st_id		Name		Subject		Dept
101		Rajesh	Java			111
102		Tom		Motor			333
103		Harry		Java			111
104		John		Arts			888

Relational --> one table is related to another table using some common column, dept columni n students table is mapped to id column in Departments table, we can not have dept record in students table which does not exist in Departments table.

SQL --> Structured Query Language

1) What is join?
displaying data from multiple tables
2) Inner join, natural join , outer join, right outer join, left outer join, self join
3) 

cross join --> no condition, cross
inner join --> common values after mapping
outer join --> extra values
left outer join --> extra values from left hand side table in query
right outer join --> extra values from right hand side table in query
self join --> join of the table with itself

1) Tell me number of rows for each join?
A			B
1			0
1			1
0			1
1			0
0			1

inner join --> 5 records
