RDBMS -Relational Database Management System
we are organising our data in terms of table
table --> rows and columns

Example: -
collage DBMS

Departments
id		Dept_Name		Location
111	computer			Block-B
222	civil				Block-C
333	mechanical		Block-D

Students
st_id		Name		Subject		Dept
101		Rajesh	Java			111
102		Tom		Motor			333
103		Harry		Java			111
104		John		Arts			888

Relational --> one table is related to another table using some common column, dept columni n students table is mapped to id column in Departments table, we can not have dept record in students table which does not exist in Departments table.
