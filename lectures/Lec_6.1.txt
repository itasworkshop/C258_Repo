spring framework
spring boot

MVC --> Model-View-Controller
Model --> Database Table/Entity/Pojo
View --> user facing layer
Controller --> /home/profile --> response should be generated


Microservices architecture --> built using multiple services for submodule

Framework --> Minimum common work which every web application will use --> lib(classes/methods) already available --> focus more on our business logic

Spring framework
IOC --> inversion of control

object --> new Pizza();

who will create my object --> IOC container
 --> bean --> Loose coupling
